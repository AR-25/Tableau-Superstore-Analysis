## Project Objective
This project aims to analyze the Superstore dataset to identify key insights into sales and profitability. The goal was to build a narrative around overall performance, product profitability, and regional trends to provide actionable recommendations.

## Key Findings & Insights
* **Overall Performance:** While sales show a consistent upward trend, profit fluctuates significantly, indicating potential issues with margin or high costs in certain periods.
* **Product Performance:** Office Supplies and Technology are the most profitable categories. However, the 'Tables' sub-category under Furniture is consistently losing a significant amount of money.
* **Geographical Performance:** The West and East coasts are major drivers of both sales and profit. Several states in the Central region, despite having moderate sales, are unprofitable.

## Tools Used
* **Tableau Public:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
